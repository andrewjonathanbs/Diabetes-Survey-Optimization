# Project 1 - Diabetes Survey Optimization
[EDA - Data Preprocessing - Modelling (LazyClassification)]

Project Overview:
* Perform an EDA to understand the correlation between data
* Eliminate parameters with low correlation with diabetes
* Data preprocessing for modelling
* Created 4 models (XGBC, LGBMC, SVC, Random Forest Regression) chosen by considering the result of LazyClassification
* Optimize the model with hyperparameter tuning and increase the accuracy
